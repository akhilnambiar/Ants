1.1) The Simulate Method in the class Ant Colony

1.2)The ant uses strategy and creates a list of all of the exits as long as the entrance is self. The bee moves out of the hive when it has achieved a certain amount of elapsed time. It will then move to a random exit from the list.

1.3)The colonies are laid out in the configure method of the class AntColony. However, the actual input that determines the inputs of the places comes from the layouts functions. You would have to change the parameters of these layouts in order to increase the amount of places.

1.4)The ants armor attribute is basically the attribute that determines if an ant is alive or not. If an ant runs out of armor, it will be removed and die.
